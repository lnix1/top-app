## TOP: Refugee Sprint REPO (Georgetown Team, Fall 2020)

This repo contains the code for an app built to help facilitate connecting refugees entering the United States with various non-profit resources. The open is intended to leverage open source solutions to the issue of database construction and management around cateloging, and making publically available, a list of non-profits offering various services to aid refugees.

To run the app locally, pull down all files from this repository into a local directory, open a command line interface (i.e. terminal for Mac/Unix systems), change your directory into the local directory containing the downloaded files, and run the appropriate launch script command for your system listed below: (for now, only a Mac launcher is provided)

$Mac$

. launch_app_mac.sh

$Windows$

$Windows PowerShell$
