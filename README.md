## TOP: Refugee Sprint REPO (Georgetown Team, Fall 2020)

This repo contains the code for an app built to help facilitate connecting refugees entering the United States with various non-profit resources. The open is intended to leverage open source solutions to the issue of database construction and management around cataloging, and making publicly available, a list of non-profits offering various services to aid refugees.

To run the app locally, pull down all files from this repository into a local directory, open a command line interface (i.e. terminal for Mac/Unix systems), change your directory into the local directory containing the downloaded files, and run the appropriate launch script command for your system listed below: (for now, only a Mac launcher is provided)

*Mac*

. launch_app_mac.sh

The launch script will create a virtual environment within the same directory (which is also listed in the .gitignore), install the app dependencies, and launch the app locally. For now, the app runs locally using Python 3, so older versions of Python will not work.
